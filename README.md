A how-to handbook for me :)

The idea behind this repository is to provide a "how-to handbook" for working with me, currently the Executive Director of the BC Government's Exchange Lab. The page is intended to be helpful, providing folx with self-serve access to things like bios; as well as insights into my motivations, preferences and ideosyncrasies. (E.g. In all likelihood I'm not mad at you - I just have RAF: resting angry face. Blame the deep lines from a ton of time spent outside :) ) By definition, none of us can be objective about ourselves, so while I've tried to provide an honest account of myself, if anything is missing here, at odds with your experience, or otherwise indicative of a glaring blindspot of mine, please lend me - and others! - a hand and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">submit a pull request</a> to make it better. Also, with <a href="https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694">credit to Cassie for pointing this out in her blog post about embarking on a similar exercise</a>, it bears noting that I'm setting this out with full knowledge that not all my needs and preferences can be met - nor do I expect them to be - but I nonetheless think there's value in making them explicit for those I work with. Last introductory point: Credit where due, along with Cassie and a handful of others who've produced/discussed "Instruction Manuals for Oneself" and the ilk, this is modeled after <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/">GitLab's CEO Handbook</a>. My hope at time of writing is that any organization I lead for a sufficient amount of time will ultimately put in place a broader handbook/guide such as GitLab's. In respect of the Exchange Lab, you can find that work in progress <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/">here</a>.

<H2>Bio</H2>
Rumon works for the Government of British Columbia as the Executive Director of the Exchange Lab, where it is his job to support the creation, cultivation and continuous learning of teams enabled and equipped to solve some of the most complex problems facing the province today. Outside government, Rumon is fiercely passionate about connecting people to the outdoors, to movement, to one another, and to the best versions of themselves. A writer, photographer, biologist and lawyer, he does so through advocacy, stories, coaching and community-building. His fiercest passions, though, are his partner, Jennie, and her two girls.
