How-to handbook for me :)

The idea behind this repository is to provide a "how-to handbook" for working with me, Rumon Carter, the Executive Director of the BC Government's Exchange Lab. The page is intended to be helpful, providing folx with self-serve access to things like bios; as well tips, tricks and insights into my motivations, preferences and ideosyncrasies. (E.g. In all likelihood I'm not mad at you - I just have RAF: resting angry face. :) ) By definition, none of us can be objective about ourselves, so while I've tried to provide an honest account of myself, if anything if missing here, at odds with your experience, or otherwise indicative of a glaring blindspot of mine, please lend me - and others! - and hand and submit a PR to make it better. 
Credit where due, this is modeled after <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/">GitLab's CEO Handbook</a> a well as a handful of other references to "Instruction Manuals for Oneself" and the ilk (none of which I can cite directly as I sit here typing this).
