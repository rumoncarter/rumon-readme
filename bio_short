Rumon works for the Government of British Columbia as the Executive Director of the Exchange Lab, where it is his job to support the creation, cultivation and continuous learning of teams enabled and equipped to solve some of the most complex problems facing the province today. Outside government, Rumon is fiercely passionate about connecting people to the outdoors, to movement, to one another, and to the best versions of themselves. A writer, photographer, biologist and lawyer, he does so through advocacy, stories, coaching and community-building. His fiercest passions, though, are his partner, Jennie, and her two girls.
